Santa needs some weather information for his flights.
He's got a computer with him that runs powershell and is on some test flights at the moment.
He wants a script he can run to get the weather at a chosen location right now.
OpenWeatherMap.org offers an API which you should be able to use (once you've signed up for free for an API key). #>
